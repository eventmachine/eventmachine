  # pure-Ruby implementation. However, we DON'T constrain them such that
  # they only run in pure-Ruby. These tests need to work identically in
  # any implementation.

  #-------------------------------------

  # The EM reactor needs to run down open connections and release other resources
  # when it stops running. Make sure this happens even if user code throws a Ruby
  # exception.
  # If exception handling is incorrect, the second test will fail with a no-bind error
  # because the TCP server opened in the first test will not have been closed.

  # Under some circumstances, the pure Ruby library would emit an Errno::ECONNREFUSED
  # exception on certain kinds of TCP connect-errors.
  # It's always been something of an open question whether EM should throw an exception
  # in these cases but the defined answer has always been to catch it the unbind method.
  # With a connect failure, the latter will always fire, but connection_completed will
  # never fire. So even though the point is arguable, it's incorrect for the pure Ruby
  # version to throw an exception.
