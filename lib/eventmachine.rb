  # Initializes and runs an event loop. This method only returns if code inside the block passed to this method
  # calls {EventMachine.stop_event_loop}. The block is executed after initializing its internal event loop but *before* running the loop,
  # therefore this block is the right place to call any code that needs event loop to run, for example, {EventMachine.start_server},
  # {EventMachine.connect} or similar methods of libraries that use EventMachine under the hood
  # (like `EventMachine::HttpRequest.new` or `AMQP.start`).
  #
  # Programs that are run for long periods of time (e.g. servers) usually start event loop by calling {EventMachine.run}, and let it
  # run "forever". It's also possible to use {EventMachine.run} to make a single client-connection to a remote server,
  # process the data flow from that single connection, and then call {EventMachine.stop_event_loop} to stop, in other words,
  # to run event loop for a short period of time (necessary to complete some operation) and then shut it down.
  #
  # Once event loop is running, it is perfectly possible to start multiple servers and clients simultaneously: content-aware
  # proxies like [Proxymachine](https://github.com/mojombo/proxymachine) do just that.
  #
  # ## Using EventMachine with Ruby on Rails and other Web application frameworks ##
  #
  # Standalone applications often run event loop on the main thread, thus blocking for their entire lifespan. In case of Web applications,
  # if you are running an EventMachine-based app server such as [Thin](http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/) or [Goliath](https://github.com/postrank-labs/goliath/),
  # they start event loop for you. Servers like Unicorn, Apache Passenger or Mongrel occupy main Ruby thread to serve HTTP(S) requests. This means
  # that calling {EventMachine.run} on the same thread is not an option (it will result in Web server never binding to the socket).
  # In that case, start event loop in a separate thread as demonstrated below.
  #
  #
  # @example Starting EventMachine event loop in the current thread to run the "Hello, world"-like Echo server example
  #
  #   #!/usr/bin/env ruby
  #
  #   require 'rubygems' # or use Bundler.setup
  #   require 'eventmachine'
  #
  #   class EchoServer < EM::Connection
  #     def receive_data(data)
  #       send_data(data)
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   EventMachine.run do
  #     EventMachine.start_server("0.0.0.0", 10000, EchoServer)
  #   end
  #
  #
  # @example Starting EventMachine event loop in a separate thread
  #
  #   # doesn't block current thread, can be used with Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, Merb, Rack
  #   # and any other application server that occupies main Ruby thread.
  #   Thread.new { EventMachine.run }
  #
  #
  # @note This method blocks calling thread. If you need to start EventMachine event loop from a Web app
  #       running on a non event-driven server (Unicorn, Apache Passenger, Mongrel), do it in a separate thread like demonstrated
  #       in one of the examples.

  # *at least* the number of seconds specified in the first parameter to

  # Initiates a TCP server (socket acceptor) on the specified IP address and port.
  #
  # The IP address must be valid on the machine where the program
  # runs, and the process must be privileged enough to listen
  # on the specified port (on Unix-like systems, superuser privileges
  # are usually required to listen on any port lower than 1024).
  # Only one listener may be running on any given address/port
  # combination. start_server will fail if the given address and port
  # are already listening on the machine, either because of a prior call
  # to {.start_server} or some unrelated process running on the machine.
  # If {.start_server} succeeds, the new network listener becomes active
  # immediately and starts accepting connections from remote peers,
  # and these connections generate callback events that are processed
  # by the code specified in the handler parameter to {.start_server}.
  #
  # The optional handler which is passed to this method is the key
  # to EventMachine's ability to handle particular network protocols.
  # The handler parameter passed to start_server must be a Ruby Module
  # that you must define. When the network server that is started by
  # start_server accepts a new connection, it instantiates a new
  # object of an anonymous class that is inherited from {EventMachine::Connection},
  # *into which your handler module have been included*. Arguments passed into start_server
  # after the class name are passed into the constructor during the instantiation.
  #
  # Your handler module may override any of the methods in {EventMachine::Connection},
  # such as {EventMachine::Connection#receive_data}, in order to implement the specific behavior
  # of the network protocol.
  #
  # Callbacks invoked in response to network events *always* take place
  # within the execution context of the object derived from {EventMachine::Connection}
  # extended by your handler module. There is one object per connection, and
  # all of the callbacks invoked for a particular connection take the form
  # of instance methods called against the corresponding {EventMachine::Connection}
  # object. Therefore, you are free to define whatever instance variables you
  # wish, in order to contain the per-connection state required by the network protocol you are
  # implementing.
  #
  # {EventMachine.start_server} is usually called inside the block passed to {EventMachine.run},
  # but it can be called from any EventMachine callback. {EventMachine.start_server} will fail
  # unless the EventMachine event loop is currently running (which is why
  # it's often called in the block suppled to {EventMachine.run}).
  #
  # You may call start_server any number of times to start up network
  # listeners on different address/port combinations. The servers will
  # all run simultaneously. More interestingly, each individual call to start_server
  # can specify a different handler module and thus implement a different
  # network protocol from all the others.
  #
  # @example
  #
  #  require 'rubygems'
  #  require 'eventmachine'
  #
  #  # Here is an example of a server that counts lines of input from the remote
  #  # peer and sends back the total number of lines received, after each line.
  #  # Try the example with more than one client connection opened via telnet,
  #  # and you will see that the line count increments independently on each
  #  # of the client connections. Also very important to note, is that the
  #  # handler for the receive_data function, which our handler redefines, may
  #  # not assume that the data it receives observes any kind of message boundaries.
  #  # Also, to use this example, be sure to change the server and port parameters
  #  # to the start_server call to values appropriate for your environment.

  # Used for UDP-based protocols. Its usage is similar to that of {EventMachine.start_server}.
  #
  # This method will create a new UDP (datagram) socket and
  # bind it to the address and port that you specify.
  # The normal callbacks (see {EventMachine.start_server}) will
  # be called as events of interest occur on the newly-created
  # socket, but there are some differences in how they behave.
  #
  # {Connection#receive_data} will be called when a datagram packet
  # is received on the socket, but unlike TCP sockets, the message
  # boundaries of the received data will be respected. In other words,
  # if the remote peer sent you a datagram of a particular size,
  # you may rely on {Connection#receive_data} to give you the
  # exact data in the packet, with the original data length.
  # Also observe that Connection#receive_data may be called with a
  # *zero-length* data payload, since empty datagrams are permitted in UDP.
  #
  # {Connection#send_data} is available with UDP packets as with TCP,
  # but there is an important difference. Because UDP communications
  # are *connectionless*, there is no implicit recipient for the packets you
  # send. Ordinarily you must specify the recipient for each packet you send.
  # However, EventMachine provides for the typical pattern of receiving a UDP datagram
  # from a remote peer, performing some operation, and then sending
  # one or more packets in response to the same remote peer.
  # To support this model easily, just use {Connection#send_data}
  # in the code that you supply for {Connection#receive_data}.
  #
  # EventMachine will provide an implicit return address for any messages sent to
  # {Connection#send_data} within the context of a {Connection#receive_data} callback,
  # and your response will automatically go to the correct remote peer.
  #
  # Observe that the port number that you supply to {EventMachine.open_datagram_socket}
  # may be zero. In this case, EventMachine will create a UDP socket
  # that is bound to an [ephemeral port](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeral_port).
  # This is not appropriate for servers that must publish a well-known
  # port to which remote peers may send datagrams. But it can be useful
  # for clients that send datagrams to other servers.
  # If you do this, you will receive any responses from the remote
  # servers through the normal {Connection#receive_data} callback.
  # Observe that you will probably have issues with firewalls blocking
  # the ephemeral port numbers, so this technique is most appropriate for LANs.
  #
  # If you wish to send datagrams to arbitrary remote peers (not
  # necessarily ones that have sent data to which you are responding),
  # then see {Connection#send_datagram}.
  #
  # DO NOT call send_data from a datagram socket outside of a {Connection#receive_data} method. Use {Connection#send_datagram}.
  # If you do use {Connection#send_data} outside of a {Connection#receive_data} method, you'll get a confusing error
  # because there is no "peer," as #send_data requires (inside of {EventMachine::Connection#receive_data},
  # {EventMachine::Connection#send_data} "fakes" the peer as described above).

  # EventMachine.defer is used for integrating blocking operations into EventMachine's control flow.
  # The action of {.defer} is to take the block specified in the first parameter (the "operation")
  # and schedule it for asynchronous execution on an internal thread pool maintained by EventMachine.
  # When the operation completes, it will pass the result computed by the block (if any)
  # back to the EventMachine reactor. Then, EventMachine calls the block specified in the
  # second parameter to {.defer} (the "callback"), as part of its normal event handling loop.
  # The result computed by the operation block is passed as a parameter to the callback.
  # You may omit the callback parameter if you don't need to execute any code after the operation completes.
  #
  # ## Caveats ##
  #
  # Note carefully that the code in your deferred operation will be executed on a separate
  # thread from the main EventMachine processing and all other Ruby threads that may exist in
  # your program. Also, multiple deferred operations may be running at once! Therefore, you
  # are responsible for ensuring that your operation code is threadsafe.
  #
  # Don't write a deferred operation that will block forever. If so, the current implementation will
  # not detect the problem, and the thread will never be returned to the pool. EventMachine limits
  # the number of threads in its pool, so if you do this enough times, your subsequent deferred
  # operations won't get a chance to run.
  #
  # @example
  #
  #  operation = proc {
  #    # perform a long-running operation here, such as a database query.
  #    "result" # as usual, the last expression evaluated in the block will be the return value.
  #  }
  #  callback = proc {|result|
  #    # do something with result here, such as send it back to a network client.
  #  }

  #
  # * File modified (written to)
  # * File moved/renamed
  # * File deleted
  #
  # EventMachine::watch_file takes a filename and a handler Module containing your custom callback methods.
  # This will setup the low level monitoring on the specified file, and create a new EventMachine::FileWatch
  # object with your Module mixed in. FileWatch is a subclass of {EventMachine::Connection}, so callbacks on this object
  # work in the familiar way. The callbacks that will be fired by EventMachine are:
  #
  # * file_modified
  # * file_moved
  # * file_deleted
  #
  # You can access the filename being monitored from within this object using {FileWatch#path}.
  #
  # When a file is deleted, {FileWatch#stop_watching} will be called after your file_deleted callback,
  # to clean up the underlying monitoring and remove EventMachine's reference to the now-useless {FileWatch} instance.
  # This will in turn call unbind, if you wish to use it.
  #
  # The corresponding system-level Errno will be raised when attempting to monitor non-existent files,
  # files with wrong permissions, or if an error occurs dealing with inotify/kqueue.

  # This method allows for direct writing of incoming data back out to another descriptor, at the C++ level in the reactor.
  # This is very efficient and especially useful for proxies where high performance is required. Propogating data from a server response
  # all the way up to Ruby, and then back down to the reactor to be sent back to the client, is often unnecessary and
  # incurs a significant performance decrease.
  #
  # The two arguments are instance of {EventMachine::Connection} subclasses, 'from' and 'to'. 'from' is the connection whose inbound data you want
  # relayed back out. 'to' is the connection to write it to.
  #
  # Once you call this method, the 'from' connection will no longer get receive_data callbacks from the reactor,
  # except in the case that 'to' connection has already closed when attempting to write to it. You can see
  # in the example, that proxy_target_unbound will be called when this occurs. After that, further incoming
  # data will be passed into receive_data as normal.
  #
  # Note also that this feature supports different types of descriptors: TCP, UDP, and pipes. You can relay
  # data from one kind to another, for example, feed a pipe from a UDP stream.

  #
  #  module ProxyConnection

    # Changed 27Dec07: Eliminated the hookable error handling.
    # No one was using it, and it degraded performance significantly.
    # It's in original_event_callback, which is dead code.
    #
    # Changed 25Jul08: Added a partial solution to the problem of exceptions
    # raised in user-written event-handlers. If such exceptions are not caught,
    # we must cause the reactor to stop, and then re-raise the exception.
    # Otherwise, the reactor doesn't stop and it's left on the call stack.
    # This is partial because we only added it to #unbind, where it's critical
    # (to keep unbind handlers from being re-entered when a stopping reactor
    # runs down open connections). It should go on the other calls to user
    # code, but the performance impact may be too large.
