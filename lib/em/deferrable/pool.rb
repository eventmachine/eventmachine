# = EM::Deferrable::Pool
#
# A simple async resource pool based on a resource and work queue. Resources
# are enqueued and work waits for resources to become available.
#
# Example:
#
#    EM.run do
#      pool  = EM::Deferrable::Pool.new
#      spawn = lambda { pool.add EM::HttpRequest.new('http://example.org') }
#      10.times { spawn[] }
#      done, scheduled = 0, 0
#    
#      check = lambda do
#        done += 1
#        if done >= scheduled
#          EM.stop
#        end
#      end
#    
#      pool.on_error { |conn| spawn[] }
#    
#      100.times do
#        pool.perform do |conn|
#          req = conn.get :path => '/', :keepalive => true
#    
#          req.callback do
#            p [:success, conn.object_id, i, req.response.size]
#            check[]
#          end
#    
#          req.errback { check[] }
#    
#          req
#        end
#      end
#    end
