  # EventMachine::Connection is a class that is instantiated
  # by EventMachine's processing loop whenever a new connection
  # is created. (New connections can be either initiated locally
  # to a remote server or accepted locally from a remote client.)
  # When a Connection object is instantiated, it <i>mixes in</i>
  # the functionality contained in the user-defined module
  # specified in calls to {EventMachine.connect} or {EventMachine.start_server}.
  # User-defined handler modules may redefine any or all of the standard
  # methods defined here, as well as add arbitrary additional code
  # that will also be mixed in.
  #
  # EventMachine manages one object inherited from EventMachine::Connection
  # (and containing the mixed-in user code) for every network connection
  # that is active at any given time.
  # The event loop will automatically call methods on EventMachine::Connection
  # objects whenever specific events occur on the corresponding connections,
  # as described below.
  #
  # This class is never instantiated by user code, and does not publish an
  # initialize method. The instance methods of EventMachine::Connection
  # which may be called by the event loop are:
  #
  # * {#post_init}
  # * {#connection_completed}
  # * {#receive_data}
  # * {#unbind}
  # * {#ssl_verify_peer} (if TLS is used)
  # * {#ssl_handshake_completed}
  #
  # All of the other instance methods defined here are called  only by user code.

    # Called by the event loop whenever data has been received by the network connection.
    # It is never called by user code. {#receive_data} is called with a single parameter, a String containing
    # the network protocol data, which may of course be binary. You will
    # generally redefine this method to perform your own processing of the incoming data.
    #
    # Here's a key point which is essential to understanding the event-driven
    # programming model: <i>EventMachine knows absolutely nothing about the protocol
    # which your code implements.</i> You must not make any assumptions about
    # the size of the incoming data packets, or about their alignment on any
    # particular intra-message or PDU boundaries (such as line breaks).
    # receive_data can and will send you arbitrary chunks of data, with the
    # only guarantee being that the data is presented to your code in the order
    # it was collected from the network. Don't even assume that the chunks of
    # data will correspond to network packets, as EventMachine can and will coalesce
    # several incoming packets into one, to improve performance. The implication for your
    # code is that you generally will need to implement some kind of a state machine
    # in your redefined implementation of receive_data. For a better understanding
    # of this, read through the examples of specific protocol handlers in EventMachine::Protocols
    #
    # The base-class implementation (which will be invoked only if you didn't override it in your protocol handler)
    # simply prints incoming data packet size to stdout.
    #
    # @param [String] data Opaque incoming data.
    # @note Depending on the protocol, buffer sizes and OS networking stack configuration, incoming data may or may not be "a complete message".
    #       It is up to this handler to detect content boundaries to determine whether all the content (for example, full HTTP request)
    #       has been received and can be processed.

    # The close can occur because your code intentionally closes it (using {#close_connection} and {#close_connection_after_writing}),
